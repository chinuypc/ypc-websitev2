              Membership is selective. Every applicant completes an interview. Every member is vetted to ensure the room stays sharp, generous, and outcome-focused. YP Club is not a networking group. It is a curated environment where founders access peer-to-peer insight, structured introductions, and the kind of conversations that do not happen at conferences.

                YP Club is a private founder community in Dubai, UAE. It was founded in 2022 by Cameron-Lee Roberts, a Qualified Chartered Accountant (ICAS) who previously worked at EY-Parthenon and Alvarez &amp; Marsal in Distressed M&amp;A and Divestitures. The club operates a selective, application-only membership for founders building businesses in the UAE. At the core of the membership is PioneerOS, a proprietary digital operating system that includes AI-curated dinner matching, the Impact Index (which tracks the financial value of introductions and deals within the network), The Vault (a private founder education library), YP Concierge (a travel and lifestyle desk), and YP Nodes (global activations at conferences). Members have raised $5M from Andreessen Horowitz, built AI companies now expanding internationally, and secured multi-six-figure contracts through introductions made inside the network. YP Club has operated for four years across Dubai, hosting hundreds of private events and facilitating connections that have led to partnerships, funding rounds, and market expansions.
